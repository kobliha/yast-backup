<H2>How to use YaST2 backup module</H2>


<P>Note: YaST2 backup module does not replace other backup utilities! The YaST2
backup module is a small, easy-to-use backup program. If you need advanced
features, such as incremental backup or network backup, you should use another
expert tool.</P>


<H3>How does YaST2 backup work?</H3>

<P> YaST2 backup module searches system for files which should be backed up and
creates archive from them. The archive contains modified files (which were
modified since system installation or package update), files not owned by any
package can be optionally added to archive. Critical system disk areas can be
added to archive too.</P>

<H3>Backup archive content</H3>

<P>Backup archive contains additional information to see when or on which
system archive was created, etc.</P>

<H3>Workflow desription</H3>


<H4>Archive setting dialog</H4>

<P>At first dialog user can enter some propeties of created archive - file
name, comment which will be stored in the archive, etc. Archive type determine
type of created archive, which utility will be used for creating archive.</P>


<P>Changed files which belong to one package are stored to one subarchive. All
package archives and additional files are archived to one big archive by tar utility.
Currently supported archive types:</P>



<UL>

<LI>tar with tar-gzip subarchives - gzip is used to compress package archives,
all files are merged to tar archive</LI>

<LI>tar with tar-bzip2 subarchives - bzip2 compression utility is used for
package archives - it has better compression ratio, but it is slower</LI>

<LI>tar with tar subarchives - no compression at all, only merging files</LI>

<LI>tar with star-* subarchives - similar to options above, but subarchives are
created by star archiver (ACLs will stored into archive)</LI>

<LI>only list file names - This option does not create backup archive,
but stores file names to file. This is useful to see which files were changed
or to use another archive program.</LI>

</UL>
</P>


<H5>Archive file options</H5>

<P>Archive can be splitted to more smaller parts. This is usefule if archive
does not fit to one medium. Size of one part can be selected from predefined
media or manually selected. Select 'User defined' as volume size to set
arbitrary volume size in the text area below.</P>

<P>Predefined floppy disk sizes are for MS-DOS formatted disks, if another file
system is used its size have to be manually entered, because it can (and
probably will) have different free space for user data.  </P>

<P>User defined size can be entered as number of bytes, kilobytes, etc. Units
with 'i' in their abbreviation are power of 2, units without 'i' are power of
10 -- 1 kB is 1000 bytes, 1kiB is 1024 bytes, etc. Number can be entered in
floating point format, values 1e3 bytes or 0.5 MiB are valid. Tar writes files 
in 10 kiB blocks (default), so created volumes can be slightly smaller then entered value.
</P>

<P>Archive volumes are named
<I>&lt;archive_directory&gt;&lt;volume_number&gt;&lt;archive_basename&gt;</I>.
Backup module does not do any check if there is available free space - all volumes
have to be stored on the disk and then moved to the floppy disks.
</P>

<H5>Backup options</H5>

<P>There are options for selecting which parts of the system will be backed up
in this dialog. Checking some options results in more dialogs in the workflow -
more information from user is required.</P>

<P>Searching files which do not belong to any package needs lots of memory,
because list of all installed files have to be read to it.</P>

<P>Rpm utility is used to search modified files. It allows verifying installed packages
by comparing current file attributes with attributes stored in RPM database.
Changed files are be detected by different MD5 sum attributes. Computing MD5 sum
takes lot of time, so it can be replaced by only comparing size and modification time 
attributes, but it is less reliable.
</P>


<H5>Excluding</H5>

<P>If backing up files not owned by any package is selected, then it can be
usefull to set which directories shoud not be backed up (e.g. /tmp)</P>

<P>In Expert settings can be selected file systems instead of directories.
Default excluded file system is iso9660 and file systems with "nodev" flag in
/proc/filesystems (e.g. nfs, proc, shm, ...). Root directory '/' is searched
always, even if its file system is selected.</P>


<H5>Seaching</H5>

<P>Seaching files starts after all unnecessary information is collected.
During searching current action or progress is displayed.</P>

<H5>Files dialog</H5>

<P>If user requested to check list of found files then  user can select which
files from found ones will be backed up.</P>


<H5>Summary dialog</H5>

<P>Here are displayed results of creating archive.</P>


<H4>Restoring from backup</H4>

<P>Files can be restored from backup archive by Yast2 Restore module or
manually using tar/star utility.</P>
